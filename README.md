An intelligent lead qualification tool that automatically identifies which leads from Apollo.io have mobile phone numbers vs. landlines. Essential for sales teams running SMS campaigns, WhatsApp outreach, or optimizing call strategies.

WhatsApp outreach to business phones (poor delivery)
Call timing optimization (mobile vs business hours)
Campaign segmentation based on phone type
